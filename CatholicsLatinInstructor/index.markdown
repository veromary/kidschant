title: Catholic's Latin Instructor
---

Fr Edward Caswall was a quiet hero of the Oxford Movement who translated hymns and authored a few of his own too. He also wrote The Catholic’s Latin Instructor which you can [buy as a paperback](http://www.lulu.com/au/en/shop/edward-caswall/the-catholics-latin-instructor/paperback/product-18844755.html). It is also available [at the internet archive](http://archive.org/details/thecatholicslati00caswuoft).

The book is a series of exercises consisting of putting together the Latin from the Mass and other popular devotions with their English translations. It does include a short Latin Grammar, but much is just a straight patching of Latin onto English. Sections are designed to cater for different groups of the faithful – one for servers, another for choirs, though there’s nothing to stop you going through all the sections.

Because of this correspondence between the Latin and the English it lends itself to flash card programs like Hot Potatoes, Quizlet.com and Anki. So the plan here is to collect supporting online materials to make this book more useful.
