For now, here is a list of articles I've written in the past:

* [Teaching Chant to your Children](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2015/aug/1/teaching-chant-your-children/)
* [Top Five Resources for Teaching Chant](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2013/may/25/top-five-resources-teaching-chant-children/)
* [Online games to learn Chant](http://www.brandt.id.au/music/online-games-learn-chant/)

Also, I put together [A New Book of Old Hymns](http://www.brandt.id.au/newbookoldhymns) - 92 pages of chant with English translations plus a growing collection of online resources to help grow the vocabulary that will facilitate singing with understanding.
