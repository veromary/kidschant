<h2>Learn to chant Pater Noster</h2>

<p>
Start with the first few lines.</p>
<blockquote>  Pater noster,<br /> qui es in caelis,<br /> sanctificetur nomen tuum.<br /> Adveniat regnum tuum.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pater</strong> means Father.  <strong>Mater</strong> means Mother.  Try using those names for your parents.</p>
<p><strong>Noster</strong> means our.</p>
<p><strong>Qui</strong> is latin for Who. There are lots of short Latin question words like Quid? Quo? Quem? Quibus? Quae?  But for today we just learn that <strong>Qui</strong> means Who.</p>
<p><strong>Es</strong> is the second person present form of the verb To Be.  In English we often say this as "you are".  In times gone by we used to say "thou art" for when we were talking to one person and "you are" for when we were talking to many.  When we say the Our Father in English we still use "art".  So, for now, learn that <strong>Es</strong> means Art - but don't confuse it with the art of drawing or painting.</p>
<p>
<strong>In caelis</strong> means in heaven.  <strong>Caelum</strong> is heaven and when we put it with an "in" we change the tail of the word.  Changing the tail of a word happens a lot in Latin.

<div class="col-md-6">
<p><strong>Sanctificetur</strong> comes from two words: <strong>Sanctus</strong> holy and <strong>facio</strong> make.  It is in the <i>passive voice</i>.  We usually say it in English as Hallowed be.  We could say Make Holy instead, or maybe Be Made Holy, but Hallowed Be is a little simpler.
</p>
<p><strong>Nomen</strong> means name.
</p>
<p><strong>Tuum</strong> means thy.  So there is a difference in word order between the Latin and English.
</p>
<p><strong>Adveniat</strong> means come.  It is related to Advent - the season where we await the coming of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Regnum</strong> means kingdom.  Another handy word is <strong>Rex</strong> meaning King.</p>
