			<h3>About Kids Chant</h3>
			<p>This page hopes to open up Gregorian Chant to youngsters.</p>
<p>Gregorian chant is highly renowned for bringing peace and facilitating contemplation in the context of cloistered religious.</p>
<p>Children can sing chant too.  Their pace is faster and sprightlier, but they can enjoy the chant melodies just like their parents.</p>
